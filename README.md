# PredatorAndPreySimulation
Simulating Evolution of Predator and Prey using Genetic Algorithms


# TODO
1. ~~Create Creature class~~
2. ~~Create Predator, Prey from Creatures~~
3. ~~Create Food class~~
4. ~~Add generation of Food supply to Simulator~~
4. ~~Generate Predator population in Simulator~~
4. ~~Generate Prey population in Simulator~~
5. ~~Add movement functions to Predator~~
6. ~~Add movement functions to Prey~~
7. ~~Detecttion of Prey/Predator/Food~~
8. ~~Choosing a direction in accordance to the detection~~
9. ~~Attraction to Prey/Preadtor/Food~~
10. ~~Choosing a direction in accordance to the attraction measures~~
11. ~~Apply net force on an entity~~
12. ~~Genetic Algorithm for breeding~~
13. ~~A net result for all weights and biases used for net force~~
14. Conculsive report
15. Graph data


## Bonus : 
1. Addition of Water Bodies
2. Adding Hiding spots
3. Control Panel for various optional features such as enabling/disabling field of view
4. Cross species effects (ones attraction effects the other)

## Branches : 
1. Main
2. Submission
3. Results and End Conclusion
